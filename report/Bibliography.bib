abstract = "We present and illustrate the simulation results of a cellular automata model describing the dynamics of a forest fire spread on a mountainous landscape taking into account factors such as the type and density of vegetation, the wind speed and direction and the spotting phenomenon. The model is used to simulate the wildfire that broke up on Spetses in August of 1990 and destroyed a major part of the Island’s forest. We used a black-box non-linear optimization approach to fine-tune some of the model’s parameters based on a geographical information system incorporating available data from the real forest fire. The comparison between the simulation and the actual-observed results showed that the proposed model predicts in a quite adequate manner the evolution characteristics in space and time of the real incident and as such could be potentially used to develop a fire risk-management tool for heterogeneous landscapes."

abstract = "In this paper a new mathematical model for predicting the spread of a fire front in homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments is presented. It is based on a bidimensional cellular automata model, whose cells stand for regular hexagonal areas of the forest. The results obtained are in agreement with the fire spreading in real forests."

abstract="The rate of spread of a wildfire increases markedly when a wind springs up. Why and how this happens is still not completely understood. However, by using a judicious mixture of laboratory experiments, field experiments, sensitivity analyses of existing wildfire spread models and physical reasoning it is possible to identify some features that have not been adequately considered in the past. In particular: (i) the energetics of wind-blown wildfires indicate that a fire-wind may not exist and that the wind may blow through the fire line. ii) The rate of spread of the fire-front depends on the atmospheric stability such that the fire-front speeds are 50{\%} or more faster during winds in the 2 to 6 m/s range under unstable conditions, iii) The wind speed acting on the flame provides an upper limit to the flame propagation speed. Existing attempts to constrain the propagation rate of fire-spread models at high wind speeds appear incorrect and, iv) wind fluctuations interacting with the standing fuel generate sweeps of downward air which carry the flame into the fuel bed and directly preheat the fuel.",

abstract="The spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of wildfire risk are challenging U.S. federal land management agencies to meet societal needs while maintaining the health of the lands they manage. In this paper we present a quantitative, geospatial wildfire risk assessment tool, developed in response to demands for improved risk-based decision frameworks. The methodology leverages off recent and significant advancements in wildfire simulation models and geospatial data acquisition and management. The tool is intended to facilitate monitoring trends in wildfire risk over time and to develop information useful in prioritizing fuels treatments and mitigation measures. Wildfire risk assessment requires analyzing the likelihood of wildfire by intensity level, and the magnitude of potential beneficial and negative effects to valued resources from fire at different intensity levels. This effort is designed to support strategic planning by systematically portraying how fire likelihood and intensity influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values at the national scale. We present results for the continental United States, analyze high risk areas by geographic region, and examine how risk evaluations changes under different assumptions with sensitivity analysis. We conclude by discussing further potential uses of the tool and research needs.",

abstract = {Abstract Santa Ana Winds (SAWs) are an integral feature of the regional climate of Southern California/Northern Baja California region, but their climate-scale behavior is poorly understood. In the present work, we identify SAWs in mesoscale dynamical downscaling of a global reanalysis from 1948 to 2012. Model winds are validated with anemometer observations. SAWs exhibit an organized pattern with strongest easterly winds on westward facing downwind slopes and muted magnitudes at sea and over desert lowlands. We construct hourly local and regional SAW indices and analyze elements of their behavior on daily, annual, and multidecadal timescales. SAWs occurrences peak in winter, but some of the strongest winds have occurred in fall. Finally, we observe that SAW intensity is influenced by prominent large-scale low-frequency modes of climate variability rooted in the tropical and north Pacific ocean-atmosphere system.},
