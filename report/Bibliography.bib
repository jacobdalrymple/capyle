abstract = "We present and illustrate the simulation results of a cellular automata model describing the dynamics of a forest fire spread on a mountainous landscape taking into account factors such as the type and density of vegetation, the wind speed and direction and the spotting phenomenon. The model is used to simulate the wildfire that broke up on Spetses in August of 1990 and destroyed a major part of the Island’s forest. We used a black-box non-linear optimization approach to fine-tune some of the model’s parameters based on a geographical information system incorporating available data from the real forest fire. The comparison between the simulation and the actual-observed results showed that the proposed model predicts in a quite adequate manner the evolution characteristics in space and time of the real incident and as such could be potentially used to develop a fire risk-management tool for heterogeneous landscapes."

abstract = "In this paper a new mathematical model for predicting the spread of a fire front in homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments is presented. It is based on a bidimensional cellular automata model, whose cells stand for regular hexagonal areas of the forest. The results obtained are in agreement with the fire spreading in real forests."

abstract="The rate of spread of a wildfire increases markedly when a wind springs up. Why and how this happens is still not completely understood. However, by using a judicious mixture of laboratory experiments, field experiments, sensitivity analyses of existing wildfire spread models and physical reasoning it is possible to identify some features that have not been adequately considered in the past. In particular: (i) the energetics of wind-blown wildfires indicate that a fire-wind may not exist and that the wind may blow through the fire line. ii) The rate of spread of the fire-front depends on the atmospheric stability such that the fire-front speeds are 50{\%} or more faster during winds in the 2 to 6 m/s range under unstable conditions, iii) The wind speed acting on the flame provides an upper limit to the flame propagation speed. Existing attempts to constrain the propagation rate of fire-spread models at high wind speeds appear incorrect and, iv) wind fluctuations interacting with the standing fuel generate sweeps of downward air which carry the flame into the fuel bed and directly preheat the fuel.",
